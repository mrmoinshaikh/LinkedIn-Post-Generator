## Tech Stack

- **Python**: The primary language used for backend development.
- **Llama 3**: The core language model used for post generation.
- **Streamlit**: A framework used to build the interactive web interface.
- **Groq Cloud**: A cloud platform for fast and scalable AI model deployment and inference.
- **Other Libraries**: pandas, NumPy, etc. (if applicable)
- 
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
Llama 3 model (or relevant dependency for the model)
Streamlit and other necessary Python libraries.
Groq Cloud account and API credentials for model inference.
Steps to Set Up Locally
Clone the repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PostForge.git
cd PostForge
Set up your environment variables by editing the .env file or setting them in your system. Ensure you have the Groq Cloud API key in the .env file or as an environment variable for authentication.

Install the required Python packages:

1. To get started we first need to get an API_KEY from here: https://console.groq.com/keys. Inside `.env` update the value of `GROQ_API_KEY` with the API_KEY you created.
2. 
3. To get started, first install the dependencies using:
    ```commandline
     pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
4. Run the streamlit app:
   ```commandline
   streamlit run main.py
   ```
   
Once the app is running, it will open in your default web browser, and you can interact with the LinkedIn post generator via the UI.

Usage
After setting up the project, you can use the generator by running the main.py script. You can customize how the posts are generated by modifying the input or tweaking the parameters.
